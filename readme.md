Welcome to the **Darknet - Market Wiki**, your comprehensive guide to navigating and utilizing the various markets available on the darknet. Whether you're a buyer, seller, or simply looking to explore, this wiki will provide you with the knowledge and tools necessary to securely engage with these platforms. The information covers everything from creating secure accounts to safely completing transactions, and everything in between.

## Market Overview

Darknet markets have become essential platforms for conducting anonymous transactions, allowing buyers and vendors to trade goods and services in a secure, private environment. These markets are typically accessed via Tor, a network that ensures anonymity by routing traffic through a series of encrypted layers. Most darknet markets accept cryptocurrency payments, with Bitcoin (BTC) and Monero (XMR) being the most popular options due to their enhanced privacy features.

### Key Features of Darknet Markets
- **Cryptocurrency Payments:** Markets typically support Bitcoin (BTC) and Monero (XMR), with Monero being preferred for its privacy features.
- **Onion Links & Mirror Sites:** Secure access to markets is provided through onion links and mirrors, which protect against downtime and ensure continued access.
- **Escrow Systems:** These markets often utilize an escrow system, holding funds securely until the buyer confirms receipt of the product, minimizing fraud.
- **PGP & 2FA:** Markets often implement PGP encryption for secure communication and Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) for added account security.

## How to Register on a Darknet Market

Creating an account on a darknet market is the first step to start buying or selling. The process is similar across most platforms but varies slightly depending on the market.

### Registration Steps:
1. **Access the Onion URL**: Visit the official onion URL or a verified mirror link through the Tor Browser.
2. **Create a Username & Strong Password**: Choose a unique username and strong password to protect your account.
3. **Set Up Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: Most markets require you to set up a 6-digit PIN as an extra layer of protection.
4. **PGP Public Key**: For encrypted communications, you’ll need to provide a PGP public key.
5. **Account Recovery**: After registration, you will receive a mnemonic recovery phrase—store it securely to recover your account in case of a password loss.
